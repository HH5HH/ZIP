## Mission
ZIP = Zeek Info Peek. ZIP into INFO from the Zendesk API.

Mission statement: Ship secure, scalable automations that connect our tools and help customers as fast as technology allows.

## What ZIP Delivers for Managers
- Near-real-time visibility into active team tickets.
- Fast pivots by Group, View, and Organization.
- Clean CSV export of exactly what the team is looking at.
- Faster standups with less tab-hopping and manual copying.

## 30-Second Launch
1. Open Zendesk dashboard.
2. Open ZIP (extension icon, context menu, or shortcut).
3. Select source: Assigned, By Group, By View, or By Org.
4. Apply filters and export CSV when needed.

## Core Team Workflows
### 1) Daily Queue Pulse
- Start with Assigned Tickets.
- Switch to By Group for team-level load.
- Sort by Updated for recency.

### 2) Team Snapshot Export
- Apply source + filters.
- Confirm row count shown in ZIP.
- Click CSV.
- Share output with leads/managers.

### 3) Escalation Drill-Down
- Click ticket ID from ZIP to jump directly into Zendesk ticket.
- Keep ZIP panel open as persistent context.

## Launch Methods
- Action click on ZIP icon.
- Context menu: Open ZIP Side Panel.
- Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+Y (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+Y (Mac).
- Horizontal option: Open ZIP Workspace Tab (Horizontal).

## User Guardrails
- ZIP is scoped to Adobe Primetime Zendesk domain.
- ZIP focuses on active work queues (not solved/closed backlog by default).
- CSV exports match the visible table rows and order.

## Manager KPI Suggestions
Track before/after adoption:
- Time to produce queue snapshots.
- Number of manual Zendesk tab switches during standup.
- Time from queue review to first action.
- Percentage of escalations opened from ZIP ticket links.

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks
- Panel not opening: reload extension and confirm Zendesk tab context.
- Empty table: clear filters and refresh source.
- Export disabled: ensure visible rows exist.
