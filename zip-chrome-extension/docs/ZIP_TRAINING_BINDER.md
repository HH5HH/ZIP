4. Apply filters and export CSV when needed.

## Core Team Workflows
### 1) Daily Queue Pulse
- Start with Assigned Tickets.
- Switch to By Group for team-level load.
- Sort by Updated for recency.

### 2) Team Snapshot Export
- Apply source + filters.
- Confirm row count shown in ZIP.
- Click CSV.

## App Mission
ZIP = Zeek Info Peek. ZIP into INFO from the Zendesk API.

Mission: Ship secure, scalable automations that connect our tools and help customers as fast as technology allows. When gatekeeping or "no shared token" roadblocks show up, we treat them as the yin to our yang - fuel for reflection, smarter design, and relentless follow-through - letting results rise on their own while we stay focused on the work, not the doubters.

## What ZIP Is
ZIP is a Chrome extension side panel companion for `https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com/*`.

Branding in this release is synced to the approved ZEEK INFO PEEK master media kit and is consistent across:
- Extension iconography
- Side panel shell and login card
- Install pages
- Training PDFs and binder

It gives agents and managers:
- Fast ticket visibility and filtering.
- Team-level pivots (By Group, By View, By Org).
- One-click refresh of the active ticket source.
- CSV export of exactly what is on screen.
- A GET API runner for Zendesk endpoints.
- Raw JSON inspection and download.

## Permissions and Trust Model
ZIP currently uses:
- `sidePanel`
- `tabs`
- `contextMenus`
- Host permission only for `https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com/*`

Practical user impact:
- ZIP does not request blanket all-sites access.
- ZIP operates against the active authenticated Zendesk browser session.
- ZIP performs read operations (GET) in the UI workflows.

============================================================

# ZIP Functionality Inventory and Documentation Workflow

This document explains how to identify, classify, and document all existing and new ZIP functionality for user-facing releases.

## Quick Start (Urgent Line Paged)
For immediate operations before full documentation review:
1. Install ZIP in Dev Mode from `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip-chrome-extension`.
2. Open Zendesk dashboard.
3. Open ZIP side panel and authenticate.
4. Use `Assigned Tickets` for immediate triage.
5. Return to this workflow doc for full release evidence mapping.

## 1. Documentation Objective
Keep user training aligned with reality by treating source code as the canonical source of truth.

## 2. Canonical Source Map
Use these files as the system map:
- `manifest.json`: permissions, commands, action behavior, version.
- `background.js`: Side Panel lifecycle, context menus, commands, tab scoping.
- `content.js`: Zendesk API calls, normalization, status filtering, auth error handling.
- `sidepanel.html`: user-visible controls and section structure.
- `sidepanel.js`: UX behavior, event handlers, workflows, exports, status text.
- `sidepanel.css`: interaction constraints and layout behavior.
- `README.md`: current user guidance baseline.

## 3. Functionality Inventory Template
For each feature, capture this schema:

| Feature ID | User-facing Name | Primary User | Trigger | Preconditions | Step Summary | Output | Failure Mode | Source Files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Use IDs like `ZIP-OPEN-001`, `ZIP-TICKETS-005`, `ZIP-API-009`.

## 5. Classifying Existing vs New for Release Notes
Use this rule set each release:
- Existing: Feature present in prior tagged version and behavior unchanged.
- Changed: Feature existed, but output, trigger, text, or constraints changed.
- New: Feature not available in prior tagged version.
- Retired: Feature removed from user access.

## 6. Repeatable Change Detection Workflow
1. Pick baseline and target:
- Baseline: last release tag or prior commit.
- Target: current release commit.
2. Run targeted diff:
- `git diff <baseline>..<target> -- zip-chrome-extension/manifest.json zip-chrome-extension/background.js zip-chrome-extension/sidepanel.html zip-chrome-extension/sidepanel.js zip-chrome-extension/content.js zip-chrome-extension/sidepanel.css zip-chrome-extension/README.md`
3. Map each diff hunk to feature IDs.
4. Update inventory rows with `New/Changed/Existing/Retired` status.
5. Update training guide and UAT cases if feature behavior changed.

## 7. User-Facing Release Notes Template

### Release `<version>` - ZIP
- Mission impact summary in one sentence.
- New:
- Changed:
- Fixed:
- Known limitations:
- User action required (if any):

## 8. Evidence Checklist Before Publishing User Docs

## 9. Documentation Ownership Model
- Product owner: approves wording for mission/value alignment.
- Technical owner: validates behavior against source.
- Support owner: validates troubleshooting clarity.
- Training owner: validates onboarding flow for new users.

## 10. Minimum Artifacts Per Release
- PRINT THIS FIRST quick-start card PDF for urgent onboarding.

## Required Evidence per Test Run
For each failed case, capture:
- Screenshot/video.
- Exact timestamp.
- ZIP version.
- Active URL.
- Status message text from ZIP footer.
- Reproduction consistency (`Always`, `Intermittent`, `One-off`).

## Pass Criteria for Training Launch
- All launch/access tests (UAT-001 through UAT-007) pass.
- All ticket workflow tests (UAT-011 through UAT-022) pass.
- Export correctness tests (UAT-023 through UAT-025) pass.

# ZIP Chrome Extension (No 3P Dependencies)

**ZIP = Zeek Info Peek** — ZIP into INFO from the Zendesk API.

## Quick Start (Urgent Line Paged)

If the urgent line just paged, do this now:
1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** ON.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip-chrome-extension`.
5. Open `https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard`.
6. Click ZIP, then click `Login with Zendesk` if prompted.
7. Click `Assigned Tickets` and start triage.

![ZIP Master Brand Preview](docs/assets/brand/zeek-info-peek-master-preview-1024.png)

**Mission:** Ship secure, scalable automations that connect our tools and help customers as fast as technology allows. When gatekeeping or "no shared token" roadblocks show up, we treat them as the yin to our yang—fuel for reflection, smarter design, and relentless follow‑through—letting results rise on their own while we stay focused on the work, not the doubters.

ZIP is now distributed as a pure Chrome Manifest V3 extension.

- No Tampermonkey
- No hosted SPA required
- No OAuth client-id prompt in local HTML

**Versioning (Automated):** This repo now auto-increments `manifest.json` on commit when ZIP app files are staged.

- Hook: `.githooks/pre-commit`
- Bump script: `scripts/auto_bump_manifest_version.sh`
- One-time setup (already run in this repo): `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`

Result: every ZIP code/content commit bumps patch version (`x.y.z` -> `x.y.(z+1)`) automatically.

After one-time install, runtime flow is:

1. Open Zendesk page
2. Click the ZIP bubble
3. If logged out, click Login with Zendesk
4. After sign-in, ZIP loads profile + assigned tickets automatically

Logged-out behavior:

- ZIP shows a branded login card and opens Zendesk authentication from the `Login with Zendesk` button.

## Brand System (Master Kit)

This build is aligned to the latest approved media assets:
- Core media kit: `/Users/minnick/Downloads/ZEEKINFOPEEK_ZIP_V5_FULL_DELIVERY.zip`
- Current app icon pack: `/Users/minnick/Downloads/ZIP_APP_ICON_PACK_round.zip`

Integrated assets now live in:
- `assets/brand/icons`
- `assets/brand/source`
- `assets/brand/splash`
- `docs/assets/brand`

Current release:
- `manifest.json` version: use current value in `zip-chrome-extension/manifest.json`

## Quick Start

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** ON.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this folder:
   - `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip-chrome-extension`
5. Open Zendesk:
   - `https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard`
6. ZIP opens and checks session automatically (floating panel button is available if collapsed).

## Team Handoff

You can hand off either of these:

1. Folder: `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip-chrome-extension`
2. Zip: `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip-chrome-extension.zip`

Also available:

- Install helper page: `/Users/minnick/Documents/PASS/ZIP/zip.html`

## Runtime Behavior

Runs only on:

- `https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com/*`

Uses active logged-in Zendesk browser session to call:

- `/api/v2/users/me.json`
- `/api/v2/search.json?query=type:ticket assignee:{email} status:open status:pending status:hold`

## Side Panel Controls

- Action click opens ZIP side panel (`openPanelOnActionClick: true`)
- Context menu:
  - `⚙ > Side panel position`
  - `Ask Eric`
- Keyboard shortcut command:
  - `Open or close ZIP side panel` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Y` / `Command+Shift+Y`)

ZIP is tab-scoped for Zendesk URLs and disabled on irrelevant domains to avoid workspace clutter.

### Left/Right Positioning Note

Chrome Side Panel supports left/right docking only (not top/bottom).
ZIP reads current side via `chrome.sidePanel.getLayout()` and keeps UI/context menu state in sync.
If Chrome exposes a programmatic setter in the running browser (`setLayout`/`setSide`), ZIP will use it.
When no setter is available, side placement remains controlled by Chrome/browser settings and ZIP opens side panel settings as fallback.

## Enterprise Option

If teammates cannot use "Load unpacked", your Chrome admin can deploy this extension via managed policy.
